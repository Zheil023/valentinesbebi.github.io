        <p>Happy Valentine’s Day, my love ❤️</p>

        <p>I made this letter because I can’t give you anything right now, I don’t have money, but I can give you all my heart and love.</p>

        <p>Three years together, and every day I feel lucky to have you. We’ve laughed, talked late at night, had silly arguments, and fixed things together. Every moment with you makes me love you more.</p>

        <p>I love your smile, your laugh, your care, and how you make even normal days feel special. You inspire me to be better and make me so proud to call you mine.</p>

        <p>Even when things get tough, we always choose each other, and that’s what makes our love real and strong. I wouldn’t trade any moment with you for anything.</p>

        <p>Thank you for loving me, for staying with me, and for being the amazing person you are. Today and every day, I’m choosing you.</p>

        <p>Happy Valentine’s Day, my love. You are my heart, my happiness, my home ❤️</p>
