        <p>Happy Valentine’s Day, my love ❤️</p>

        <p>I made this letter because I can’t give you anything right now, I don’t have money, but I can give you all of my heart and words, and all the love I have for you.</p>

        <p>Three years together. Wow. When I really think about it, it’s not just a number. It’s late-night talks, laughs until our stomachs hurt, silly arguments that we always fix, and a million little moments that made me love you more.</p>

        <p>Being with you has shown me what love really is. It’s not just about the easy, perfect days. It’s about sticking together when things get messy, helping each other through hard days, and still choosing each other every single time. That’s us. That’s real love.</p>

        <p>I love your smile. I love your laugh. I love how you care so much, even when you’re tired or stressed. I love how you somehow make even boring days feel special. I love everything about you, even the little things you don’t notice about yourself.</p>

        <p>Proud of your strength.<br>
        Proud of your heart.<br>
        Proud of your love.<br>
        Proud to call you mine.</p>

        <p>You make me want to be better, not because anyone tells me to, but because you deserve the best version of me. Your patience, your kindness, your way of always trying, it makes me fall in love with you more every single day.</p>

        <p>Even when we argue or don’t understand each other, my love for you never goes away. We talk it out, fix it, and come out stronger. That’s what I love about us. We don’t give up. We grow together.</p>

        <p>Thinking about all the memories we’ve made over these three years makes me so happy. From cozy nights in to random adventures, each little thing with you is something I’ll never forget. I wouldn’t trade a single moment for anything.</p>

        <p>I think about our future a lot too. The little routines we’ll have, the laughter in our home, the dreams we’ll chase together. You’re my favorite person, my safe place, my home, and I can’t wait to keep building this life with you.</p>

        <p>Even when life is tough or stressful, knowing I have you makes everything better. Your love gives me strength, your heart gives me hope, and just being around you makes my day brighter.</p>

        <p>I love you more than words can ever show. I love you more than I probably let on sometimes. I love you more than yesterday, and less than tomorrow because I’ll keep loving you more every single day.</p>

        <p>Thank you for staying with me, for loving me, for laughing with me, for holding me, for everything. Thank you for being you, the amazing, incredible, beautiful you.</p>

        <p>Today, on Valentine’s Day, I just want you to know I’m still choosing you. Not just today, not just because it’s Valentine’s, but every day. I choose you. I choose your heart, your love, your laughter, your everything. I choose us.</p>

        <p>Happy Valentine’s Day, my love. Today and always, you are my heart, my happiness, my home ❤️</p>
